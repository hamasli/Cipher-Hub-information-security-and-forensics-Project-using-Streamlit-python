# Cryptifyhub

### University Project for Information Security and Forensics

Welcome to Cipher Hub, a web application developed as part of my university project for the course "Information Security and Forensics." This project showcases various encryption techniques implemented using the Streamlit Python library.

## Features

Cipher Hub includes implementations of the following five popular ciphers:

1. **Vigen√®re Cipher**
2. **Hashing (widely used today)**
3. **Rail Fence Cipher**
4. **Playfair Cipher**
5. **Caesar Cipher**

Each cipher technique is accompanied by comprehensive documentation to facilitate understanding and practical implementation.

## Installation

To run the Cipher Hub web app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/cipher-hub.git
    cd cipher-hub
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the Streamlit app:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can access the Cipher Hub through your web browser. The user-friendly interface allows you to explore and utilize different encryption techniques.

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is provided within the application to help you understand each cipher technique and its implementation.
